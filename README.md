# odin-landing-page

This is the second project that I will be working on in the course of Odin Project

The project consists of creating, styling and aligning elements with the use of HTML and CSS

There is a reference web page from Odin Project in the folder for a comparison of my work

As usual, I will be trying to use git and best practices for the version control of this project
