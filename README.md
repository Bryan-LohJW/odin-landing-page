# odin-landing-page

This is the second project that I will be working on in the course of Odin Project

The project consists of creating, styling and aligning elements with the use of HTML and CSS

There is a reference web page from Odin Project in the folder for a comparison of my work

As usual, I will be trying to use git and best practices for the version control of this project

---

After completing the project, there are still many things that I require to practice
-best practices for alignment within page
-content styling and alignment including padding, margin
-best practices for commit

Overall, the page looks decent but there can still be improvements to be made for it to look more like the reference
